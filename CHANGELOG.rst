30th January 2009
  * Various bug fixes
  * Major code restructuring
  * PTP now defaults to old multicast mac address (can be set to
    802.1as multicast with build flag)


15th January 2009

  * Various bug fixes.

  * 802.1AS support.

  * First spec of host side API for communicating to an XMOS device
    implementing AVB.


19th December 2008

  * Media clock recovery now fully based on 802.1AS
    timestamps. Presentation time is honoured.

  * Changed 1588v2 timing protocol to 802.1as (note that some issues
    remain - see release notes for details)

10th December 2008

  * Code now runs codec in slave mode on the listener and implements
    media clock recovery.

  * Fixed timestamp to match spec. Timestamps are generated every 8
    samples (according to IEC61883-6 SYT_INTERVAL)  - so a valid
    timestamp is generated every 3 out of 4 packets

  * Implemented internal bandwidth restriction in mac layer. Each
    link going the mac layer (e.g. ptp, avb stream)
    can be set to use no more than a certain number of Mbps of
    bandwidth (see the mac_set_bandwidth function).

27th November 2008

  * Fixed bug in Mii ethernet layer that hung the demo when a short
    (<64 bytes) packet was received.


21st November 2008

  * General internal code restructuring to prepare for future
    enhancements
  * Fixed timestamp generation issues, AVB packets are now timestamped
    every packet (i.e. every 6 samples) corrected
  * Fixed incorrect DBC value creation
  * Tested on RevB silicon
