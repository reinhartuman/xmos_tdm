Combined repository for a Clean XMOS AVB build

This repository is a combination of source code provided by XMOS on github, mainly sw_avb_lc, sc_avb, sc_ethernet, sc_otp_board_info, sc_util, sc_slicekit_support and sc_i2s.

The only additional stuff added is TDM support provided by Thomas Gmeinder also on github.

This is not a official XMOS release as it consists out of the most current github releases for each of the listed XMOS repositories.
