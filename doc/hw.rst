Hardware development platforms
------------------------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
For initial development of AVB applications the following XMOS
development platforms are recommended:

  * `XK-AVB-LC-SYS AVB Audio Endpoint <http://www.xmos.com/products/reference-designs/avb>`_

In addition the following kit can be used for development:

  * `SliceKIT Core Board <http://www.xmos.com/discover/products/xkits/slicekit#slicekit-core-board>`_ with 1 x Ethernet slice and 1 x Audio slice fitted with CS2100-CP PLL. 

=======
For initial development of single Ethernet port AVB applications the following XMOS
development platform is recommended:

  * `XK-AVB-LC-SYS AVB Audio Endpoint <http://www.xmos.com/products/reference-designs/avb>`_

It is recommended to have at least two boards for developing streaming audio applications. It is also recommended that an AVB compatible network switch be obtained and used while developing the system.

For developing an application specific board for AVB please
refer to the hardware guides for the above boards which contain example
