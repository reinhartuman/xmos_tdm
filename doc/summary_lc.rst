Summary
=======

The XMOS Audio Video Bridging (AVB) endpoint is a reference design that provides time-synchronized, low latency streaming services through IEEE 802 networks. The solution is firmware that is implemented on the XMOS xCORE architecture and can be deployed on a number of different xCORE parts depending on system requirements such as stream and channel count.
