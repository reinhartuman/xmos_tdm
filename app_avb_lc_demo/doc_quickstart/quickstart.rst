#. A `Download` link will appear where the `Request Access` link previously appeared. Click and download the firmware zip.


Installing xTIMEcomposer Studio
-------------------------------

The AVB-LC software requires xTIMEcomposer version 13.0.2 or greater. It can be downloaded at the following URL

   `Projects` list.
 
#. Click **Finish**.

#. Select the ``app_avb_lc_demo`` project in the Project Explorer and click the **Build** icon in the main toolbar.

Installing the application onto flash memory
--------------------------------------------

#. Connect the xTAG-2 debug adapter (XA-SK-XTAG2) to the first AVB endpoint board. 
#. Plug the xTAG-2 into your development system via USB.
#. Plug in the 5V power adapter and connect it to the AVB endpoint board.
#. In xTIMEcomposer, right-click on the binary within the *app_avb_lc_demo/bin* folder of the project.
#. Choose `Flash As` |submenu| `Flash Configurations`.
#. Double click `xCORE Application` in the left panel.
#. Choose `hardware` in `Device options` and select the relevant xTAG-2 adapter.

Refer to the above figure for board controls and connectors.

#. Connect the two development boards into an AVB capable Ethernet switch via the provided Ethernet cables
#. Set the audio input connection jumpers for either RCA input or 3.5 mm jack input.
#. On the first development board, connect the output of a line-level audio source to the audio input connector.
#. On the second development board, connect an audio playback device to the audio output connector.
#. If not already powered, connect the power supplies to the input power jacks of the boards and power them on.
#. A third party 1722.1 Controller application can then be used to connect and disconnect streams between the endpoints.

   See https://github.com/audioscience/avdecc-lib for an example command line 1722.1 controller application and library.

.. note:: 
    Note: The audio output from the board is line level. If using headphones, an external headphone amplifier may be required.
