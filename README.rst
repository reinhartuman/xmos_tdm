Firmware Overview
=================

This firmware is a reference endpoint implementation of Audio Video Bridging protocols for XMOS silicon. It includes a PTP time
server to provide a stable wallclock reference and clock recovery to synchronise listener audio to talker audio
codecs. The Stream Reservation Protocol is used to reserve bandwidth through 802.1 network infrastructure.
